Much of the black ice is created by the\\r\\nmoisture tracked onto roadways by vehicles and from vehicles’ exhaust systems.\\r\\nBlack ice forms when temperatures drop rapidly and any moisture on the road\\r\\nfreezes into a smooth, nearly invisible, slippery surface.

According to NWS “widespread blowing snow will significantly reduce the visibility. The hazardous conditions will impact the Wednesday evening and Thursday morning commutes. The dangerously cold wind chills as low as 40 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.” \\nNDDOT\\r\\nsnow plows will be out into the evening and then again in the early morning\\r\\nhours. Snow plows do not run 24 hours a day and motorists are urged to travel\\r\\nsafely and take necessary precautions. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Know Before You Go” by checking\\r\\n     road conditions BEFORE you travel. Check the Travel Information Map or call 511. Let someone know\\r\\n     when you depart, your route, and expected arrival time. Do not leave\\r\\n     without a full fuel tank.\\nNever use cruise control on wet or\\r\\n     ice roadways.\\nPassing trucks may create snow\\r\\n     fog. This greatly reduces your visibility. \\nTurn on your lights.
