Travel Advisory LIFTED for northeast; Travel Alert remains in effect for
portions of eastern ND The North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) along with
the North Dakota Highway Patrol (NDHP) have LIFTED the No Travel
Advisory for northeast North Dakota including Grand Forks and surrounding
areas. A Travel Alert is in effect
for the northeast portion of the state including Grand Forks and surrounding
areas due to reduced visibility. In addition, a Travel Alert remains in effect for Valley City, Jamestown,
Ellendale and Ashley due to blowing snow creating areas of reduced visibility. A Travel Alert means conditions are
such that motorists can still travel in these areas, but should be advised of
changing conditions.  The National Weather Service has a Wind Chill Warning out for
most of the state until noon (CST) on Thursday. A Wind Chill Warning means the
combination of very cold air and the wind will create dangerously low wind
chill values. Frostbite can occur quickly and even hypothermia or death if
precautions are not taken.  If traveling here are some tips to keep you safe:·         Carry a fully
charged cell phone.·         Let someone
know when you depart, your route, and expected arrival time.·         Dress
according to weather conditions. Keep dry and wear clothing in layers.·         Do not leave
without a full fuel tank.·         Pack a winter
survival kit with items such as blankets, candle, water, flashlight and food. ·         If you were to
become stranded; stay with your vehicle, run the engine if extremely cold, and
keep exhaust pipe clear of snow.  The NDDOT and NDHP warn the public to be aware that, with these
very cold temperatures, black ice may be encountered on roadways, especially in
high traffic areas. Bridge decks in the metro areas can become extremely icy
during these cold temperatures. Much of the black ice is created by the
moisture tracked onto roadways by vehicles and from vehicles’ exhaust systems.
Black ice forms when temperatures drop rapidly and any moisture on the road
freezes into a smooth, nearly invisible, slippery surface. This thin layer of
ice is very hard for motorists to detect, so drivers need to be especially
vigilant in looking for changes in a road’s surface that may affect traction. All travelers are encouraged to monitor road conditions as weather
conditions occur and use caution while traveling. For road information, call
511 from any type of phone or go to the website: www.dot.nd.gov . The NDDOT
works hard to keep travelers informed of road conditions. However, the road
conditions are not reported 24 hours a day but updated every day from 5 a.m. to
10 p.m. Central Time, including holidays. It’s important to remember that the
conditions may vary from what is being reported.",No Travel Advisory  for northeast; Travel Alert remains at effect for portions of eastern ND,At No Travel Advisory  for northeast; Travel Alert remains at effect for portions of eastern ND,At No Travel Advisory  for northeast; Travel Alert remains at effect for portions of eastern ND,At No Travel Advisory  for northeast; Travel Alert remains at effect for portions of eastern ND,At No Travel Advisory  for northeast; Travel Alert remains at effect for portions of eastern ND,{'ND'},{'ND'},{'ND'},{'ND'},{'ND'},{'ND'},{'ND'}

129,129,NDDOT reminds motorists to use caution as blizzard conditions are forecast for eastern ND ,"The North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) is urging motorists to use caution as blizzard conditions are expected in eastern portions of the state Wednesday night and Thursday. National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a Blizzard Warning for eastern North Dakota from 6 pm Wednesday to noon CST on Thursday, January 24. According to NWS “widespread blowing snow will significantly reduce the visibility. The hazardous conditions will impact the Wednesday evening and Thursday morning commutes. The dangerously cold wind chills as low as 40 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.” 
NDDOT
snow plows will be out into the evening and then again in the early morning
hours. Snow plows do not run 24 hours a day and motorists are urged to travel
safely and take necessary precautions. 
 

“Know Before You Go” by checking
     road conditions BEFORE you travel. Check the Travel Information Map or call 511. Let someone know
     when you depart, your route, and expected arrival time. Do not leave
     without a full fuel tank.
Never use cruise control on wet or
     ice roadways.
Passing trucks may create snow
     fog. This greatly reduces your visibility. 
Turn on your lights. This will
     increase your visibility to other motorists and snowplow operators. 
Carry a winter survival kit in
     your vehicle: warm clothing, footwear, shovel, energy food, etc.
If your vehicle becomes stuck in a
     snowstorm, stay with the vehicle! Most deaths occur when people leave
     their vehicles and get lost. 

The
NDDOT also issues travel warnings on state highways and interstates. These
warnings should be taken seriously and are for the safety of the traveling
public. There are three categories you should familiarize yourself with:

Travel
     Alert- Motorists can still travel but
     may encounter areas of challenging winter weather driving conditions on
     roadways. 
No
     Travel Advisory- Motorists
     should NOT TRAVEL due to hazardous conditions which make it unsafe
     to travel.
Road
     Closed or Blocked- Motorists
     are not allowed to travel on closed roads due to life threatening
     conditions.

prepared for winter travel. To learn more about winter driving safety or road

131,131,Motorists asked to use caution when passing vehicles as snow fog may occur,"Motorists
are asked to use caution when meeting and passing vehicles and passing
snowplows as today’s snow fall may create “snow fog” or whiteout conditions.
Snow fog occurs when plowing light snow or cross winds from vehicles when
meeting or passing them. The best practice for
motorists is to be patient and wait until the snowplow pulls over to pass.
Also, it is recommended to reduce your speed and double your normal following
distance when following a snowplow.
Motorists are encouraged to reduce speeds, drive
according to the conditions and always wear your seat belt. All travelers are encouraged to monitor road conditions
as weather conditions occur and use caution while traveling. For road
